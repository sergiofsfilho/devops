# Sergio Francisco - DevOps toolbox
This is my personal repository intended to document what I'm learning and to store the code that I developed during my learning of the DevOps world.

I just started it and for while I do not know exactly how to structure it, so, I'll be updating it as soon as I advance through my study.

* Should I mention that I'm also using it as a way to practice my English skills and to learn Markdown? :) *

## Tools that I want to learn with this process
* Git (as a modern version control system)
* Markdown (as a way to document my code)
* Packer (for creating templates to VirtualBox, VMware and AWS)
* Terraform (for provision infrastructure)
* Docker
* Ansible
